        "The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a simple hand game played between two players. It is often used as a decision-making tool or a playful way to make choices between two individuals. The game involves three hand shapes, each representing one of the three options: \"rock,\" \"paper,\" or \"scissors.\" The rules are straightforward:\n",

        "1. Rock crushes Scissors: Rock wins against Scissors.\n",

        "The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is typically played in a series of rounds. Each player makes their choice by forming one of the hand shapes (rock, paper, or scissors) simultaneously. Then, the choices are revealed, and the winner of the round is determined based on the rules above. The game continues until a predetermined number of rounds are completed, and the player with the most wins is declared the overall winner.\n"
